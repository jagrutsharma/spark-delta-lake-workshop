# SF Bay Area ACM Spark and Delta Lake Workshop

The following agenda is for an event for [The San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of ACM](www.sfbayacm.org) for SQL people who are new to large-scale transactional data processing using Apache Spark and Delta Lake.

The workshop is on April 2 - 3 (Sat & Sun) from 10am - 1pm Pacific.

The workshop is comprised of six one-hour modules focusing on Apache Spark and Delta Lake - where each module is 30-45min lecture and 15-30min lab work (which could be run on Databricks Community Edition / DBCE).

## Abstract

This 2-day workshop is intended to teach you what Apache Sparkâ„¢ and Delta Lake are and how to use them in your data architectures for reliable large-scale distributed data pipelines.

This course will show the features of Delta Lake that, alongside Spark SQL and Spark Structured Streaming, introduce ACID transactions and time travel (data versioning) to your ETL batch and streaming workloads.

Slides, demos, exercises, and Q&A sessions should all together help you understand the concepts of the modern data lakehouse architecture.
